<p>The objectives of this assignment are to test your ability to create XML documents that contain well-defined information and to develop web pages using HTML with CSS. This assignment will be developed further in Assignment 2.</p>
<div class="warning">
<h3 id="generated">Warning - HTML, XML, CSS Generating Tools</h3>
<p>You are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to use tools which <em>generate</em> HTML, XML, XSLT or CSS code, either from a visual representation or otherwise. This includes DreamWeaver, Microsoft Frontpage, saving to HTML from MS Word, etc. You must write all code yourself in a plain-text editor such as NotePad. Any assignments that use code generated from a tool will be given <strong>ZERO</strong>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>
<p>Newcastle travel agent <em>goHoliday</em> plans to expand their business through online selling of holiday packages and providing holiday advice to customers. The first step is to build a website to allow customers register online and book different types of holiday packages such as adventure holidays, beach holidays, family holidays, budget holidays, luxury holidays, season holidays, cruise holidays, or honeymoon holidays.</p>
<p>As a promising student of SENG1050, you are invited to develop a web site for <em>goHoliday</em>. To construct the web page, you will choose 2 of the categories listed above. For each category, you will provide a page listing 3 holiday packages. For example, if you choose Beach Holiday as a category, your page will list 3 beach holiday packages.</p>
<p>Your task is to present these holidays as appealingly as possible on the web. This will involve,</p>
<ol>
<li>Creating an <a href="#template">XML template</a> and <a href="#dtd">DTD</a></li>
<li>Creating two <a href="#objects">XML documents</a></li>
<li>Developing <a href="#web">a home page</a> for the site.</li>
</ol>
<p>Details of all these requirements are given below.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="template">XML Template</h2>
<p>The template must be a <strong>valid</strong> XML file. The important parts of this template are the tags (i.e., the organization of the data), <strong>not the actual data</strong> about any holiday package. However, you may need to include some arbitrary data to allow your page to be validated. For example, if the <em>default</em> of an attribute is #REQUIRED, the attribute needs a value otherwise it will not be validated.</p>
<h3>XML Specification</h3>
<p>As new attractions are discovered and tourism opportunities developed, new categories of holidays can be created and promoted. For example, the future development of consumer-level space flight is expected to eventually lead to the creation of space holidays. So goHoliday's IT team, responsible for page updating and maintenance, will need an XML template that they can copy and use for all new categories. The template will be used for your example holidays described below.</p>
<p>The document should be able to store as many holiday packages as required within a given category. You will decide the tags that you wish to use to describe the holiday. For each holiday, you will at least have element tags for the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Package Name (only one)</li>
<li>Description (only one)</li>
<li>Cost</li>
<li>Number of Nights</li>
<li>Popularity (number of stars out of five)</li>
<li>Accommodation Options (at least one)
<ul>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Additional cost (or mark as included with the package)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Coupon Code (zero or one)</li>
<li>Reviews (zero or more)</li>
<li>The filename of a promotional picture (one or more, use a relative path)</li>
<li>URL of the destination's external promotional webpage (use an absolute path)</li>
</ul>
<p>At least 1 tag must have an attribute. If you include only the items mentioned above you will <strong>NOT</strong> get full marks for the assignment. In addition, you will add at least 2 more tags that make your template different from others.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="dtd">DTD</h2>
<p>You will write a DTD for your XML. Generally, it is your choice whether the DTD is internal or external; however, for the SENG1050 assignment, you will make the DTD internal because it is easier to validate your XML and DTD.</p>
<p>Your DTD will to describe all the tags and attributes that you used in your XML. It is important to use optional modifiers (+, *, ?) to indicate how many instances of each tag are allowed.</p>
<p>In your DTD, define at least one entity (&lt;!ENTITY&gt;) and use it in the XML document.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="objects">XML documents</h2>
<p>Once you have your XML template with DTD, you will make 2 separate XML documents by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choosing two categories, and</li>
<li>Creating one XML document for each category.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each XML document must contain:
<ul>
<li><strong>data</strong> for 3 holiday packages, and</li>
<li>the internal DTD at the top of the document.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The DTDs in 2 XML documents must be the same.</li>
<li>The 2 XML documents must have the same tags and DTD as the XML template.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="web">Homepage Development</h2>
<p>You will develop the Homepage for <em>goHolidays</em> by creating the following files:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#all">Homepage (index.html)</a></li>
<li><a href="#css">Cascading Style Sheet (style.css)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Your site map will look as follows: <br /> <img src="SiteMap.jpg" alt="Site Map" /></p>

</ul>
</li>

</ul>

<div class="warning">
<h3 id="plagiarism">Warning - Plagiarism</h3>
<p>Plagiarism is defined as <dfn>presenting the work of others' as if it was your own</dfn>. This includes the copying of content from other people's Web pages (and other sources) without "appropriate referencing" (indicating the parts of your assignment which have been copied and where they were copied from).</p>
<p>If you "quote" other people's work (or images) in your assignments, then you <strong>must</strong> reference them appropriately (use a README.txt file to do this). Failure to do so will cause you to lose marks for the assignment. An assignment that consists largely of work copied from elsewhere will receive very low (zero) marks, and may be reported to the School for suspicion of plagiarism.</p>
