<h3 id="generated">Warning - HTML Generating Tools</h3>
<p>You are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to use a HTML generating program for this assignment. This includes DreamWeaver, Microsoft Frontpage, Saving to HTML from Word, etc. You must write all of the HTML tags yourself in a plain-text editor such as NotePad. Any assignments that use HTML generated from a tool will be given <strong>ZERO</strong>.</p>
</div>
<hr />
<h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>
<p>The directors of goHoliday have decided to expand their site to include holiday suggestions submitted by the public. To this end your project is now to create a website at which people can complete a form recommending a holiday with all the details required by the goHoliday team.</p>
<p>The goHoliday team do not want a website with a sterile, professional look about it, but would prefer a simple, friendly and attractive website.</p>
<p>Your task now is to build a friendly, welcoming website with functionality for data collection of the nature of the <em>Holiday Pages</em> of Assignment 1. In the interest of transparency, the information is to be displayed on the web page in such a way that it matches the website theme.</p>
<p>Your assignment will have the following parts.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#home">A Homepage</a></li>
<li><a href="#form">A "Data Collection" page</a></li>
<li><a href="#peb">2 Category pages</a> with descriptions of THREE holiday packages in the category.</li>
</ol>
<p>All pages must have good readability, consistency and navigation. Details of all of these pages are given below.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="all">General guidelines for preparing your all web pages</h2>
<ul>
<li>All pages will be coded according to the HTML5 standard.</li>
<li>All pages will contain the full HTML5 document structure, including &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;, &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, &lt;title&gt; and &lt;body&gt;</li>
<li>All pages will use Cascading Style Sheets for visual formatting. You must use an external style file (style.css) which will define the style for all web pages you have created, Embedded (Document-level) style (where appropriate) and a few (NOT many) inline styles.
<ul>
<li>All visual formatting of the Web site will be implemented using <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/">Cascading Style Sheets</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Use one external CSS for all web pages.</strong></li>
<li>Use at least one <em>id</em> and one <em>class</em> selector.</li>
<li>At least one &lt;div&gt;, used to provide some interesting styling (your choice of borders, background, floating alignment, etc.)</li>
<li>At least one &lt;span&gt;, used to provide some formatting (e.g. a colour or font change) for a few words of text</li>
<li>Use a document-level style sheet to apply styles that are unique to the particular page (if appropriate).</li>
<li>Only use inline styles for one-off visual effects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your assignment directory will contain a sub-directory, named <em>images</em> with all the image files you are using in your web pages.</li>
<li>A nice background for the whole web site is required. The text must be readable with the background.</li>
<li>A left side margin of 1 cm for all pages will be used.</li>
<li>Use hyperlinks on each of the pages that provide navigation capabilities for your site.
<ul>
<li>Hyperlinks from the Index page to other pages. Also hyperlinks from other pages back to the Index page. These links should use <em>a relative</em> URL.</li>
<li>Each page should also have links to every other page.</li>
<li>The text colours of a link before they are visited, after they are visited and during a user action must be different from each other. The link must appear noticibly bigger when you move the cursor over them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The pages must have good readability, consistency and navigation.</li>
<li>Comments for your HTML code, including comments at the top of the file, stating the name of the file, the name of the author and the date the file was created.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="home">Homepage</h2>
<p>Your submission will contain a homepage, called <b>index.html</b> which you created in Assignment 1. You may need to make changes to this page, to ensure that any links to other pages in the website work, or incorporate any other updates listed in your Assignment 1 feedback.</p>
<p>Links necessary for the Homepage are</p>
<ul>
<li>A link to the data collection page (form).</li>
<li>A privacy policy. This is necessary as you are collecting data including personal identifying information (PII) from your guests. When creating this, you may use a template such as that at <a href="https://www.visser.com.au/blog/generic-privacy-policy-for-australian-websites/">https://www.visser.com.au/blog/generic-privacy-policy-for-australian-websites/</a></li>
<li>Terms and conditions. Use template at <a href="https://termly.io/resources/templates/terms-and-conditions-template/">https://termly.io/resources/templates/terms-and-conditions-template/</a></li>
<li>About us. Use template at <a href="https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/best-about-us-pages">https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/best-about-us-pages</a></li>
<li>Contact. Follow examples at <a href="https://www.ventureharbour.com/15-contact-form-examples-help-design-ultimate-contact-page/">https://www.ventureharbour.com/15-contact-form-examples-help-design-ultimate-contact-page/</a>. This need only be mail, email and telephone - include other contacts if you wish.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="form">Data Collection Page</h2>
<p>As we already know, the goHoliday team want a form for <em>Data Collection</em> where a member of the public can submit a holiday suggestion for publication.</p>
<p>This page will allow website visitors (users) to provide details about their suggested holiday. This will be done as a form, which sends the information to http://jkorpela.fi/cgi-bin/echo.cgi when they click the "Submit" button. The following things need to be included on the page.</p>
<ol>
<li>An appropriate level 1 heading.</li>
<li>Information about the person submitting
<ul>
<li>Their name (use 1 or 2 text fields here - your choice)</li>
<li>Their email address.</li>
<li>How many previous holidays they have submitted.</li>
<li>A binary choice question such as whether or not they have been on a holiday in the past 5 years (not necessarily this - feel free make up your own question). Apply a default response here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Information about the suggested holiday - Include at least the following:
<ul>
<li>Name of the holiday</li>
<li>A dropdown box for the user to indicate the category of the holiday i.e. beach, luxury, adventure, etc.</li>
<li>A textfield for the user to enter a description.</li>
<li>Checkboxes to indicate whether accommodation pricing is included, whether a coupon code is known, or any other property that you have listed in Assignment 1.</li>
<li>Buttons to submit and clear the form</li>
<li>A copyright statement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you include only the items mentioned above you will <strong>NOT</strong> get full marks for the assignment. In addition, you will collect at least 2 more relevant pieces of information that make your form different from others. Use a variety of form input types.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Validate the form</h3>
<p>You will write <strong>Javascript functions</strong> to validate the form (<i>DO NOT USE HTML5 form validation attributes such as 'required'</i>).</p>
<ol>
<li>Use JavaScript to perform client-side data validation.</li>
<li>The validation functions should check that at least three required inputs (marked with asterisks) in your form are filled out.</li>
<li>These should be different types of input (e.g., textbox, dropdown menus, radio buttons or checkboxes), so the validation will be done differently for each one.</li>
<li>The validation functions should check a valid email address (<i>please do not use HTML5 form validation INPUT types such as INPUT type="email"</i>).</li>
<li>If the form does not pass the validation check, the user should be presented with an alert message asking them to provide the missing information or correct the wrong information.</li>
</ol>
<p>The validation functions should be initiated when the form is submitted.</p>
<p>The structure and presentation of this page is up to you however the specifications provided here must be followed.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="peb">Category Pages</h2>
<p>You will be writing an XSLT document to embed your XML holiday pages from Assignment 1 into HTML. The HTML that is generated should fit in with the style of the rest of your website (ie similar formatting, colors, etc). You will need to use CSS in your generated HTML.</p>
<p>Note that all your XML holiday pages have the same tags and DTD and therefore they can all use the same XSLT document. This means you will only make 1 XSLT file, which will have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A heading which mentions the category you used for your holiday pages in Assignment 1 (e.g., beach, luxury, adventure)</li>
<li>List of all the holiday packages, sorted alphabetically by holiday name and including the following.
<ul>
<li>The holiday description</li>
<li>Link to the website/s (if any) related to the holiday package.</li>
<li>An image of the holiday.</li>
<li>All extra data that you stored for each holiday, such as accommodation, number of nights</li>
<li>All this data must be collected from the XML holiday pages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Any other information that is in your XML files.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="visual">Visual Formatting</h2>
<ul>
<li>All visual formatting of the Web site will be implemented using <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/">Cascading Style Sheets</a>.</li>
<li>All documents will share a common external style sheet.
<ul>
<li>You will use classes to apply styles to common types of content.</li>
<li>For example, the copyright notice at the bottom of each page could be in a division with <code>class="copyright"</code> with a common style defined in the external style sheet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use a document-level style sheet to apply styles that are unique to the particular page (if appropriate).</li>
<li>Use only inline styles for one-off visual effects.
<ul>
<li>Before doing so, you should consider whether the effect might be reused in the future on other tags in the page or in other pages - if the answer is yes, place it in the document-level or external style sheets.</li>
<li>Even if the visual effect is a one-off, you should still use the <code>class</code> attribute to indicate the semantic reason for the visual formatting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="design">Web Design</h2>
<p>A successful website must meet clearly identified goals and provide compelling content that draws target audience to the site. In addition it should be easy to navigate and feature visual attractiveness.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="style">Coding Style</h2>
<p>Your HTML code, CSS code and XSL code must be neat, clear, indented, and commented.</p>
<p>Other than the specifications mentioned, the way you design your page is up to you. However it should use semantically-correct tags. All your work should be validated.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="submit">Submission</h2>
<p>Your submission should contain all the files that contribute to the Web site, including HTML, CSS, XML, XSL and image files. You must also include a <span class="file">README.txt</span> file, containing your student number, list of the files that are part of your submission, and the original sources of any data, images, etc taken from other places.</p>
<p>Finally, your submission should include a completed Assignment Cover Sheet. You should download a cover sheet template, then fill in the details and include it with your submission. <em>Note:</em> an Assignment Cover Sheet submitted electronically is deemed to have been signed. Your assignment <strong>cannot</strong> be marked until a completed cover sheet is received.</p>
<p>Failure to follow submission instructions will incur a penalty.</p>
<div class="warning">
<h3 id="plagiarism">Warning - Plagiarism</h3>
<p>Plagiarism is defined as <dfn>presenting the work of others' as if it were your own</dfn>. This includes the copying of content, including images, from other people's Web pages (and other sources) without "appropriate referencing" (indicating the parts of your assignment which have been copied and where they were copied from).</p>
<p>If you "quote" or use other people's work in your assignments, then you <strong>must</strong> reference them appropriately. If you fail to do so you will be reported to the School's Student Academic Conduct Officer (SACO) for suspicion of plagiarism. An assignment that consists largely of work copied from elsewhere and referenced appropriately will receive very low (zero) marks.</p>
<p>You can find more information on the University's Policy on Student Academic Integrity in the Course Outline and at <a href="http://www.newcastle.edu.au/policylibrary/000608.html">http://www.newcastle.edu.au/policylibrary/000608.html</a>. You can find advise on quotation and appropriate referencing in the <a href="http://libguides.newcastle.edu.au/managingyourreferences">InfoSkills</a> Web site.</p>
</div>
<p>The assignment is to be submitted on <a href="https://uonline.newcastle.edu.au/webapps/portal/execute/tabs/tabAction?tab_tab_group_id=_181_1">Blackboard</a> via the <strong>Assignments</strong> page . To submit your files, place them all into a single <span class="file">.zip</span> archive named with <b>your student id</b> (eg., <span class="file">c3012345.zip</span>).</p>
<p>If you have trouble submitting, contact me as soon as you can. Failure to submit correctly is not of itself a sufficient reason to apply for Adverse Circumstances on the assignment.</p>
